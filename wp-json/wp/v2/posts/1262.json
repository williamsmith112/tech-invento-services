Even if there\u2019s an app for your printer brand, differences in software could prevent you from connecting directly.

AirPrint allows you to instantly print photos direct from your Photo Stream, as well as print directly from your Safari app. Once your printer is set up, here\u2019s how you use Airprint:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Select the app you want to print from, and tap the \u201cShare\u201d icon (HERE) or \u201cSettings\u201d icon (HERE).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Select (HERE) or hit \u201cPrint\u201d<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pick a AirPrint-ready printer from the list<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Most troubleshooting for AirPrint that doesn\u2019t stem from WiFi glitches come from compatibility issues. Not every app is AirPrint ready, and while AirPrint is becoming more common with newer WiFi printers, not every model comes pre-loaded. Double check your users manual to make sure your printer is compatible.
