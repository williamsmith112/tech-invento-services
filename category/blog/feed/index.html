<p>There is a number of reasons why your printer might not be printing even if you just installed a fresh cartridge of ink. Try checking through this list to eliminate the possibilities:</p>



<ul>
<li>Try printing a test page to see what colors are missing. If there are any missing colors, you might have clogged printheads. Here’s how to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ldproducts.com/blog/troubleshooting-printer-problems/#section8">fix clogged printheads</a>.</li>



<li>You left the yellow tape on the new cartridge or maybe the cartridge is not installed.</li>



<li>You have an outdated printer driver</li>



<li>Clear the printer queue.</li>



<li>Do a hard reset on your printer. To do this you just need to turn off your printer, unplug for a few minutes and then plug the printer again. If that still doesn’t work, try turning the printer and your computer off, and then start it back up again.</li>



<li>Try uninstalling and then reinstalling your printer driver.</li>
</ul>

<p>Everyone wants to enjoy the convenience of being able to print directly from their&nbsp;iPhone®, iPad® or Android® mobile device. But wirelessly connecting your printer and device can be complicated, and the process will vary from brand to brand. Even if there’s an app for your printer brand, differences in software could prevent you from connecting directly. Make sure that your WiFi is properly working if you are having difficulty connecting, using the process outlined above. If your wireless printer connection isn’t functioning smoothly, downloading different apps or deleting existing ones won’t help.</p>



<p>Here are some ways to set up your printer for mobile printing, and troubleshoot to see why your printer isn’t connecting:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>AirPrint for Apple®</strong></h3>



<p>Printers from each major manufacturer come pre-loaded with&nbsp;<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201311" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple’s AirPrint software</a>, which makes connecting your iPhone, iPad, or laptop simple. AirPrint allows you to instantly print photos direct from your Photo Stream, as well as print directly from your Safari app. Once your printer is set up, here’s how you use Airprint:</p>



<ul>
<li>Select the app you want to print from, and tap the “Share” icon (HERE) or “Settings” icon (HERE).</li>



<li>Select (HERE) or hit “Print”</li>



<li>Pick a AirPrint-ready printer from the list</li>
</ul>



<p>Most troubleshooting for AirPrint that doesn’t stem from WiFi glitches come from compatibility issues. Not every app is AirPrint ready, and while AirPrint is becoming more common with newer WiFi printers, not every model comes pre-loaded. Double check your users manual to make sure your printer is compatible. If not, there are other easy ways to connect your Apple products to your printer wirelessly.</p>

<p>Wireless connectivity is a double-edged blade. On the one hand, you can connect your printer to devices anywhere in your home. On the other, your connection is something that you can’t see. If your printer has dropped its Wi-fi signal, often you won’t be able to tell unless you troubleshoot the connectivity. If your printer’s Wi-fi is down, unplug it and reconnect it to your modem. It’s a bit of a trope these days, but powering down electronics can do wonders for fixing problems. If your device isn’t connecting to your printer, check to see that your Wi-fi and Bluetooth capabilities are up and operational.</p>



<p>A weak (or nonexistent!) connection between your computer and printer will prevent you from getting the documents you need. And because the issues lie between the two, often it can be tough to diagnose. If your printer was connecting wirelessly to your printer and then stopped, try restarting your computer and printer to see if they will reconnect. If no, here are some common questions you should ask when you suspect your WiFi connection may be to blame for your issues.</p>



<ul>
<li>Is your printer connected to your network? Printing a Wireless Network Test Report is the easiest way to check and see on HP printers. Go to your control panel and select Wireless Network Test Report (on some models, you can access this directly by hitting the wireless button). This report will give you insights into connectivity, the units connected to the network, and the Network Name (SSID address)—from which you can see if your unit is connecting to the network. Consider restarting your router and printer to reconnect.</li>



<li>Is your computer connected to the network? For Windows users, select the HP Print and Scan Doctor discussed above to check. For Apple users, click on the Wireless logo in the top right-hand corner of your screen. Is your network checked? &nbsp;</li>



<li>Was anything on your computer changed recently? Updates to your security software, firewalls, browser, and operating system can result in connection issues with your printer. You may need to reconnect your computer to the network, reconfigure your protection settings to include printers, or install an updated driver, depending on the nature of your updates. If you updated software, consider restoring your system back to the original settings/version to see if that reconnects you.</li>



<li>Was your router replaced recently? Chances are you’ll need to reconfigure your printer and computer to reconnect with the network. Check to see if your new router is assigned a different ISP address, which will need reconfiguration.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are having trouble diagnosing your printer issue, printing a test page or printer status report can help narrow down what the problem is.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the test page prints successfully then your issue is likely the printer driver, printer software or cable connection.&nbsp; If it doesn’t print properly then there is likely an issue with the printer itself and may require repairs.</p>

<p>If you are trying to connect to a new printer on Windows 10 and plan to print over Wi-Fi, you may be able to print right away without downloading the printer software.  Windows 10 is compatible with most new printers right out of the gate.  To add a new printer, go to <strong>Settings > Devices > Printers &amp; Scanners</strong>> <strong>Add Printer </strong>and select the printer you want to add.  If you plan to use this printer regularly you can set it as your default printer and also print a test page to test for print quality before printing out your document!</p>

<p>Hardware isn’t always to blame. Your printer driver acts as the translator between your computer and your printer.  Like other software, drivers can also go out of date, or lose compatibility with your operating system after an update. If your printer isn’t responding to basic commands or is constantly crashing, a driver update may fix the issue right away.  You could also have the wrong driver downloaded on your computer to work with your printer. Uninstalling the driver you have on your desktop, then replacing it with an up-to-date version, often will get your printer and desktop chatting again.  To find an updated version of your printer driver, visit the support page of your printer manufacturer and type in your printer model number.  Then follow the steps on the page to download the most up to date version.  We’ve included links to the most popular printer brand support pages below!</p>
